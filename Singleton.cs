/*
 *The Generic Singleton presented here is crafted to allow the creation of singleton instances for different types.
 * 
 * Usage:
 * - Create a singleton class that implements => public class SampleSingletonClass : Singleton<SampleSingletonClass>
 * - Access the singleton instance using SampleSingletonClass.Instance.

 * Note: This class employs a lock mechanism to safely operate in multi-threaded environments.
